## Parser Rules

Parser rules are used to change field values or to add user tags to events sent into the parser.

## Rule Files

Rules are loaded from JSON files using the command `logzilla rules add somefile.json`

## Rule Overview

Each rule must define a `match` condition and at least one of the following:

- `update`: a key-value map of fields and their eventual values
- `drop`: a boolean flag indicating the matched event should be ignored/dropped (not inserted into LogZilla).

### Basic Rule Example


```json
{
    "match": {
        "field": "host",
        "value": [
            "host_a", "host_b"
        ]
    },
    "update": {
        "program": "new_program_name",
        "host": "new_host_name"
    }
}
```
In this example, the rule above changes the incoming event in the following manner:

1. Match on either `host_a` or `host_b`
2. Set the `program` field to `new_program_name`
3. Set the `host` field to `new_host_name`


## Rule Syntax

### Match Conditions

* `match` may be a single condition or an array of conditions.
* If `match` is an array, it will only match if **ALL** conditions are met (implied `AND`).
* Each condition must define a `field` and `value` along with an optional `op` (match operator).
* `value` may be a string or an array of strings.
* If `value` is an array, the condition will be met if **ANY** element of the array matches (implied `OR`).

#### Valid `match` examples:

```json

"match": [
    { "field": "program", "value": ["program_a", "program_b"] },
    { "field": "host", "op": "ne" "value": "127.0.0.1" },
    { "field": "message", "op": "=~" "value": "\d+foo\s?bar" },
]
```

### Operators
Operators control the way the `match` condition is applied. If no `op` is supplied, the default operator `eq` is assumed.

| Operator | Match Type        | Description                                                                                   |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| eq       | String or Integer | Matches entire incoming message against the string/integer specified in the `match` condition |
| ne       | String or Integer | Does *not* match anything in the incoming message `match` field.                              |
| gt       | Integer Only      | Given integer is greater than the incoming integer value                                      |
| lt       | Integer Only      | Given integer is less than the incoming integer value                                         |
| ge       | Integer Only      | Given integer is greater than or equal to the incoming integer value                          |
| le       | Integer Only      | Given integer is less than or equal to the incoming integer value                             |
| =~       | RegEx             | Match based on RegEx pattern                                                                  |
| !~       | RegEx             | Does *not* match based on RegEx pattern                                                       |
| =*       | RegEx             | RegEx appears anywhere in the incoming message                                                |


## Rewriting Fields
To transform an incoming event into a new string, use the `update` keyword.

When replacing incoming event parts, the rules can reuse events from the original field's values in three ways:

1. Capturing RegEx sub-matches
2. key/value parsing of the incoming MESSAGE field
3. Full string values of incoming MESSAGE, HOST and/or PROGRAM fields
4. Combinations of the above (i.e. these features may be used together in a single rule)

To replace parts from `field` RegEx operators in an `update`, one or more of its values must contain capture references.

These RegEx capture references **must not** be escaped.
**Example**: `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.

- `$1` is the correct way to replace the value with the captured RegEx.
- `\$1` would match `$1` *literally* (and would not reference the RegEx captured).
- One (and exactly one) `match` condition must capture these sub-matches.
- The value must be a RegEx string with at least as many captures used by the `update` fields.
- The condition must have the `op` (operator) set as a RegEx operator, e.g.: `"=~"`.
- If the operator type (`op`) is excluded, `eq` will be assumed.


#### RegEx Rewrite Example

The following rule rewrites a `program` field on events `not` originating from the host named `127.0.0.1`.

1. Match on the `message` field
2. Use the RegEx operator of `=~`
3. Match on any message containing either of the strings set in the `value`
4. Do not consider this a match if the `host` is `127.0.0.1`
5. If the above criteria are met, set the `program` name to `$1` (the RegEx capture obtained from the `value` in the `match` statement).

```json
{
    "match": [
        {
            "field": "message",
            "op": "=~",
            "value": [
                "output of program (\w+)",
                "error while running (\w+)"
            ],
        }, {
            "field": "host", "value": "127.0.0.1", "op": "ne"
        }
    ],
    "update": {
        "program": "$1"
    }
}
```

## Key/Value Example

To use the key=value parser, one or more of the `update` fields must reference an unescaped key variable `${KEY_NAME}` from the incoming event. It will be replaced only if the text of the `message` matches. Note that at least one explicit `match` condition must still be applied.

For example, the following rule will rewrite the entire message of an incoming Juniper event (which uses key/value pairs).

Sample Original Incoming Message (before rewrite):

> Note: the sample message below is *only* the message itself and doesn't include the host, pri, or program.

```
2017-07-03T12:23:33.146 SRX5800 RT_FLOW - RT_FLOW_SESSION_CREATE [junos@2636.1.1.1.2.26 source-address="1.2.7.19" source-port="46157" destination-address="2.4.21.21" destination-port="443" service-name="junos-https" nat-source-address="6.12.7.29" nat-source-port="46157" nat-destination-address="1.3.21.22" nat-destination-port="443" src-nat-rule-name="None" dst-nat-rule-name="SSL-vpn" protocol-id="6" policy-name="SSL" source-zone-name="intn" destination-zone-name="dmz" session-id-2="3341217" username="N/A" roles="N/A" packet-incoming-interface="eth0.1"]
```

**Desired Outcome:**

1. Match on the incoming `message` field using a RegEx operator.
2. Rewrite the entire message using the defined string with key=value as well as the captured RegEx.
3. Set the `program` name to `Juniper`.
4. Create a second `match` condition and match on the `Juniper` program set in the first `match`.
5. Use RegEx to find out if the `message` contains the word *reason*
6. If it does contain a *reason* value, then add that *reason* to the message.


```json
{
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {
      "match": {
        "field": "message",
        "op": "=~",
        "value": "(\\S+) (\\S+) \\S+ - RT_FLOW_(SESSION_\\w+)"
      },
      "update": {
        "message": "$3 reason=${reason} src=${source-address} dst=${destination-address} src-port=${source-port} dst-port=${destination-port} service=${service-name} policy=${policy-name} nat-src=${nat-source-address} nat-src-port=${nat-source-port} nat-dst=${nat-destination-address} nat-dst-port=${nat-destination-port} src-nat-rule=${src-nat-rule-name} dst-nat-rule=${dst-nat-rule-name} protocol=${protocol-id} src-zone=${source-zone-name} dst-zone=${destination-zone-name} session-id=${session-id-32} ingress-interface=${packet-incoming-interface} $2 $1",
        "program": "Juniper"
      }
    },
    {
      "match": [
        {
          "value": "Juniper",
          "field": "program"
        },
        {
          "value": "(.+?) reason= (.+)",
          "field": "message"
        }
      ],
      "update": {
        "message": "$1 $2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### The `Update` keyword

The `update` keyword may also be used to "recall" any of:

1. Message (the message itself)
2. Host - The host name
3. Program - The program name

#### `Update` Example

```json
"update": {
    "message": "$PROGRAM run on $HOST: $MESSAGE",
},
```

### Dropping events - `drop` keyword

To completely ignore events coming into LogZilla, use `"drop": true`.

This can be used to remove noise and only focus on important events.

> Note that `drop` cannot be used with any keyword except `match`.

#### Drop example

The following example shows how to completely ignore diagnostic messages from a program called `thermald`.

```json
{
    "rewrite_rules": [
        {
            "match": [
                { "field": "program", "value": "thermald"},
                { "field": "severity", "op": "ge", "value": 6}
            ],
            "drop": true
        },
    ]
}
```

Operator `"ge"` means `greater or equal`, so it only drops events of severity 6 (informational) and 7 (debug).


### Skipping after first match - `first_match_only` flag

The `first_match_only` flag tells the Parser to stop trying to match events on each rule of the rule file after the first time it matches.

This can be useful when there is a need to update a field based on array of rules, but they are mutually exclusive.

Note that `first_match_only` is not an option of a singular rule, but whole rule file

#### First match only example

```json
{
    "rewrite_rules": [
        {
            "match": { "field": "program", "value": "MSU_Makerbot"},
            "update": { "program": "Makerbot" }
        },
        {
            "match": { "field": "program", "op": "=~", "value": "[%#]([\w-#|]+?-\d+-\w+)" },
            "update": { "program": "Cisco" }
        },
        {
            "match": {
                "field":"message", "op":"=~",
                "value": "(\\d*)\\s+(MSWinEventLog|Microsoft-Windows|Windows)-(\\S+)"
            },
            "update": {"program": "MSWin-$3", "message":"EventID=$1 $MESSAGE"},
        }
    ],
    "first_match_only": true
}
```

With `first_match_only`, the Parser won't waste time and resources to try to match Makerbot and Cisco events to Windows-specific rules.
> Note that this flag only affects the scope of *this* current rule file (not all JSON files in `/etc/logzilla/rules.d/`. Regardless of whether or not any of these rules match, other rule files which do make a match will still be applied.


## Rule Order

* All JSON rules files are processed in alphabetical order.
* The Rules contained in each file are processed sequentially.
* If there are multiple rules with the same matching criteria, the last rule wins.

### Rule Order Example

**file1.json**

```json

{
    "rewrite_rules": [
        {
            "comment": "rule1",
            "match": {
                "field": "host",
                "value": "host_a"
            },
            "update": {"program": "new_program_name"}
        }
    ]
}
```

**file2.json**

```json
{
    "rewrite_rules": [
        {
            "comment": "rule2",
            "match": {
                "field": "host",
                "value": "host_a"
            },
            "update": {"program": "new_program_name2"}
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Result

Events matching the filters above will have the following properties.

```json
{
    ...
    "program": "new_program_name2", #### rule2
}
```
