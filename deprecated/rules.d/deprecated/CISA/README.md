## Summary
This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CKÂ®) version 8 framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 8 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is aware of compromises of U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations by an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor beginning in at least March 2020. This APT actor has demonstrated patience, operational security, and complex tradecraft in these intrusions. CISA expects that removing this threat actor from compromised environments will be highly complex and challenging for organizations.

One of the initial access vectors for this activity is a supply chain compromise of the following SolarWinds Orion products (see Appendix A).

* Orion Platform 2019.4 HF5, version 2019.4.5200.9083
* Orion Platform 2020.2 RC1, version 2020.2.100.12219
* Orion Platform 2020.2 RC2, version 2020.2.5200.12394
* Orion Platform 2020.2, 2020.2 HF1, version 2020.2.5300.12432
