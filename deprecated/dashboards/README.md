# LogZilla Dashboards Transition

The conventional LogZilla Dashboards previously available in this repository have been updated. We've seamlessly moved all our dashboards into the more streamlined LogZilla Apps format. You can effortlessly activate these directly from the LogZilla platform. For detailed steps, navigate to *Settings->App Store* in the LogZilla UI or consult our official documentation at [https://docs.logzilla.net](https://docs.logzilla.net).
