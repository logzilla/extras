# LogZilla Triggers Transition

The traditional LogZilla Triggers housed in this repository have undergone a transformation. All our triggers have been refined and incorporated into the versatile LogZilla Apps format. You can directly activate these from within the LogZilla interface. To get started, navigate to *Settings->App Store* in the LogZilla UI or delve into our official documentation at [https://docs.logzilla.net](https://docs.logzilla.net).
