  - Fix UDM hostnames
  - Someone should really get Ubiquiti to fix their syslog header
  - Sadly, the UDM Pro doesn't even put the hostname in the hostname field
  - So you will have to manually do it here :(
  - Change the following match value from 50c9676c6d24 to
  - match on your UDM's mac address, and manually set the IP
  - this is a HORRIBLE way to do it, but Ubi needs to learn how to syslog
